    "This program uses a Random Forest Classifier to classify categorical data. The dataset is first loaded from categorical_dataset.csv. Since it lacks a target variable, a synthetic binary target (0 or 1) is generated randomly for demonstration purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The features (X) are separated from the target (y). As all features are categorical, preprocessing is necessary. A ColumnTransformer is applied with OneHotEncoder, which transforms categorical values into numerical form that machine learning models can handle.\n",

    "A Pipeline is then built, consisting of two steps:\n",

    "Random Forest Classifier – an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and aggregates their results, improving accuracy and reducing overfitting compared to a single decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is divided into training and test sets using an 80/20 split. The Random Forest model is trained on the training data with fit(). Predictions are generated on the test set using predict().\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, model performance is evaluated with accuracy_score. This score reflects how well the Random Forest classified the unseen test data. Typically, Random Forests outperform single decision trees because they combine multiple weak learners into a strong, more robust classifier."
